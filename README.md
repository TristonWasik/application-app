# Triston Wasik Job Hunting Adventure

## What is this

This is a simple app I threw together to document my 2024 job hunting adventure after being laid off. It's also helping me document my job hunting progress for unemployment. The applications are currently flatfiled so anyone can update them to their own needs if they wish to use this.

## Install & Setup

1. Clone repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TristonWasik/application-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```shell
cd ./application-app
npm i
```

3. Start dev server

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

I use caprover to host all of my apps. I provided a createTar.bat for convenience. Drag and drop the tarball into caprover and it'll deploy.
